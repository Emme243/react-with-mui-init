# CHANGELOG

## Sat 11/05/2022
- Improved the way translations are written, translation object must be called as the component name but in snake case. 
Example: if we have a component called `MyComponent` the translation object must be called `my_component` in locale files.
- Improved the way we get translations, now we use a custom hook called `useLocale` that returns translations by component names.
